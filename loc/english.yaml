# Objectives
obj_blade_01: "Enter the warehouse"
obj_blade_01_desc: "Find a way into the warehouse."
obj_blade_02: "Find the correct container"
obj_blade_02_desc: |
  The sword is hidden somewhere in a container, there must be clues around the place.
  Maybe the triads have something on them that could help, or maybe some shipping logs somewhere.
obj_blade_03: "Open the container"
obj_blade_03_stealth_desc: |
  The container is secured with a lock and high voltage power.
  Ripping out the cable doesn't seem to be an option but it can probably be jammed somehow.
obj_blade_03_loud_desc: |
  The container is secured with a lock and high voltage power.
  The alarm is preventing any jamming but overloading the main power could collapse the system.
obj_blade_03b: "Investigate the Container"
obj_blade_03b_desc: |
  Check the opened container and look for the sword.
obj_blade_04: "Signal the pilot"
obj_blade_04_desc: |
  Light a flare on the roof to signal the landing zone for the pilot.
obj_blade_05: "Clear the roof while waiting for the pilot"
obj_blade_05_desc: |
  The pilot needs the landing zone clear of any cops. Make sure there are no cops on the roof.
obj_blade_06: "Keep the landing zone clear and secure the loot"
obj_blade_06_desc: |
  Secure the loot but don't let the cops get near the helicopter. 
obj_blade_07: "Take the Scubagear and escape or secure more loot"
obj_blade_07_desc: |
  Take the scuba gear you used to get here and escape under the cover of the river.
obj_blade_08: "Secure the sword"
obj_blade_08_desc: |
  Set up a zipline to the boat and secure the sword.
